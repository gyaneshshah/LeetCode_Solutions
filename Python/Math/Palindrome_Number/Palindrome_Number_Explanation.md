# Palindrome Number

This is an Easy Math question

## Question
Given an integer *x*, return true if *x* is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

## Approach
We can convert the number into a string and reverse it to check for palindrome.
We can directly return the boolean value if reverse of the string value of **x** is equal to its string value.
