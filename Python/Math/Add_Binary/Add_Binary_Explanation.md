# Add Binary

This is an Easy Math question

## Question
Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

## Approach
We convert the string binary numbers to int and then add them. We then use the *bin* function to convert them into binary and return the string except the first two characters (0b).
