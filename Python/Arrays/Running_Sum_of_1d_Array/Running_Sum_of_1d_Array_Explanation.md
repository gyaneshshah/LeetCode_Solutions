# Running Sum of 1d Array

This is an Easy Array question

## Queestion
Given an array *nums*. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of *nums*.

## Approach
This is a simple problem, We can iterate over **nums** and keep on adding the values, at every step we append that in another array.
I have added them in an array call **arr** which we return after the loop ends.
