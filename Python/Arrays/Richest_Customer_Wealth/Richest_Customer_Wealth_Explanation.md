# Richest Customer Wealth

This is an Easy Array question

## Question
You are given an m x n integer *grid* accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

## Approach
We can use list comprehension to create an array with total wealth of each customer.
I have created an array **wealth** to store that.
We return the maximum value of **wealth*8
