# Find the Difference

This is an Easy Hash Table question

## Question
You are given two strings `s` and `t`.
String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Approach
To find the extra letter, we well sort the strings and check at each step if there is a difference in the letter in `s` and `t`.
We will sort `t` and `s` first. Then we will run a loop (of length `s`, as it is the smaller string) to iterate over the characters.
If at any index `t` and `s` are not same we will return the character in `t` at that point. If in any case the extra letter is in the end, we shall after the loop return the last character of `t`.
