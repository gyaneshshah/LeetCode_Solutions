# LeetCode Solutions

## Description
This repository serves as a personal collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are implemented in Python and SQL and organized by topics such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, etc. Currently, the repository is not open to external contributions as I am actively building the solution database by solving problems.

The primary goal is to document and share my problem-solving journey on LeetCode, providing both a learning resource for others and a track record of my progress.

## Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders: Python and SQL. Each of these folders contains subfolders based on problem topics, such as Arrays, Strings, etc. Inside these topic folders, you'll find individual folders for each problem. Each problem folder contains two files:
- One Python solution file (.py)
- One explanation file in markdown format (.md)

In SQL, the solution files are in .sql format. Please note that sometimes the table formatting in SQL may not be properly displayed in the preview. If you encounter any issues, I recommend clicking on the code view to get a better view.

## Naming Convention
Each problem folder follows the same naming convention as the corresponding LeetCode problem, replacing spaces with underscores ('_'). This ensures a consistent and easily navigable structure.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the solutions and explanations provided. If you have any questions or suggestions, you can reach out to me.

## Note on Contributions
As of now, I am not actively seeking external contributions. However, I may consider contributions in the future. Stay tuned for updates.
