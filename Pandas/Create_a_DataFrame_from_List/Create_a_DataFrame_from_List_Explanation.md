# Create a DataFrame from List

This is an Easy Pandas question

## Question
Write a solution to create a DataFrame from a 2D list called `student_data`. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of some students.
The DataFrame should have two columns, student_id and age, and be in the same order as the original 2D list.
The result format is in the following example.

## Approach
We use the in-built DataFrame function to convert the list into a dataframe. We pass `student_data` as the data and `student_id` and `age` as columns.
We return the dataframe.
